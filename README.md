# Become-A-Wise-Investor-On-Lending-Club
LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.  Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), I will build a model that can predict wether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan. This way in the future when there is a new potential customer I can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan.
